			<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to create a working button that will generate random text.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a couple of problems including typos in classifying our elements in jQuery which I was able to identify and fix.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this lab was pretty fun to do since we messed around with CSS to customize our speech bubbles.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results/Script Output</h2>
					<p>Here is the results of our script! Everytime you click the button, text should appear in the box below like a a speech bubble when your texting on your phone.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<button id="make-combo">Say Something</button>
