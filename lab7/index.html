			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to get a string, turn it into an array, sort it, then print the result.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We initially thought console.log() would run our script, but that wasn't the case. We reread the instructions and realized we were meant to use document.writeln()! When we did that, our script started working.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was fairly easy since we did a demonstration in class already, however, we were not able to complete Task X.</p>
					<p class="task">Task X: Bonus!
						Here are some additional experiments to try for extra special bonus points. Perform experiments to answer one or more of these questions and provide screenshots and a paragraph to explain.
						<ol class="task">
						<li>How does sort() deal with upper and lowercase? Can you make your function sort lowercase and uppercase together?</li>
						<li>Can you make your function ignore/omit spaces?</li>
						<li>Can you make your function shuffle the user's name to create an Anagram? Can you make it capitalize the words properly?</li>
						<li>When you output a name, can you make your script output a div with a class that is styled in your css?</li>
						<li>Can you make it so window.prompt() happens outside of your functions, then pass the name as a parameter to the functions and return the result?</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
					We unfortunately did not have enough time to work on figuring out Task X, 
					because this day was the only day Ruby was available to work on this lab 
					this week as she is really busy. After today, we would not have been able to 
					meet and we figured it would be better off that we worked all that we could 
					today and have one point off for not doing Task X.
					</p>

					<h2>Results/Script Output</h2>
					<p>So you entered your name! Here's what our script did to it :3</p>
