							<p1>Hi my name is Franchesca, and I am typing as my partner, Ruby, is driving.</p1><br>
							<p1>We are taking this class together and we are roommates.</p1><br>
							<p1>We both have limited experience in coding and are both excited to take this class.</p1><br>
							<p1>We are working on compiling a banana pile in our room, right now we have seven bananas.</p1><br> 
							<p1>We have employed outside help for our endeavor, AKA our friends.</p1><br> 
							<p1>Overall, the pile is satisfactory, but not to the ceiling.</p1><br> 
							<p1>There is never enough bananas to be had.</p1><br>
