			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was challenging because we had a really hard time understanding the lecture so we had to reference from multiple outside sources to understnad how to call the Yes/No api correctly. For this lab, we used the Yes/No API to generate a random answer to a question you can ask!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>As mentioned previously, we had trouble understanding how to get the API to work using the "core recipe" provided in the lecture slides. We were able to figure this out by referencing a youtube video and Wes' version of his lab.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was definitely the toughest, but I'm glad we went through it because we ended up learning how to correctly use and call APIs using JavaScript!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results/Script Output</h2>
					<p>Here is what we came up with!</p>
					<div class="output-section">
						<p class="bold">ASK A YES OR NO QUESTION</p>
						<input id="input">
						<button id="activate">Find out your fate...</button>
						<div id="the-question"></div>
						<div id="output"></div>
