			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Subject</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab is to understand file structures by creating a local file on my computer, like index.html files, and then eventually upload them to the server!<br></p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My lab partner and I did not run into any problems so far in this lab. It was fairly easy to understand, and I do already have experience when it comes to coding, however I would not consider myself an expert.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>If you are reading this, that means you are already looking at the results of my index.html file!<br></p>
					<p>Here's how most of it looks like in code:</p>
