			<div class="minor-section special-section" id="challenges">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges for this lab was to make sure we were selecting the right elements in order for our "Make Special" buttons work.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section special-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem we ran into was the button click not functioning correctly. We found out what was wrong by using console.log and found out the reason why it wasn't working was because the we forgot to add a "#" to the selector.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section special-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was intriguing to me because we are finally getting into more functional topics now. It was very fulfilling seeing the buttons work after they weren't working for a while.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section special-section" id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You can see the results of our script by clicking the "Make Special" buttons in each section!</p>
					<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
