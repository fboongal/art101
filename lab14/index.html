			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging & Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to go back to one of our old labs and to debug them! For the sake of this lab we used our Lab 8, Anonymous Functions & Callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem/bugs that occurred was that our arrays were not printing with correct commas and spaces. After feed back from one of our TA's(Ilia the GOAT!) we were able to figure out how to separate the arrays correctly using .join(", "). We also separated our outputs in different divs instead of putting them all into one.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results/Script Output</h2>
					<p class="bold">This is how the Lab 8 results used to look like:</p>
					<div class="mini-section">
						<p><div id="old"></div></p>
					</div>

					<p class="bold">This is how Lab 8 looks like now, after debugging:</p>
					<div class="mini-section">
						<p>This is an array: <div id="output1"></div></p>
						<p>This is the array when +3 is added to each number: <div id="output2"></div></p>
						<p>This is the array when -3 is subtracted to each number: <div id="output3"></div></p>
					</div>
