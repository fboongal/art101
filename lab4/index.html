					Pseudocode Tasks/Lists

					Task 1: Create Digital Art
					1. Figure out out what you want to draw
					2. Research your topic 
						a. create a mood board for inspiration and reference
					3. Figure out what program you want to use and launch it
					4. Sketch out a draft of what you want to draw
					5. Create an outline layer in your program and outline your sketch
					6. Create a color layer and apply flat colors to your drawing
					7. Create a shading layer and apply shading to the flat colors
					8. Polish your drawing by going over any mistakes you make have done or by adding any additional details
					9. Once you are satisfied with your drawing, flatten all of your layers
					10. Export your drawing to a format of your liking
					11. Post or share wherever

					Task 2: Rock-Paper-Scissors
					1. Print the board before each turn
					2. Accept user input from player
					3. Validate move
					4. Choose random computer move
					5. Evaluate moves from player and computer
					6. Test if win, lose, or draw condition

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The Challenge of this lab is to get into the habit of thinking in lists before jumping into code. We created Pseudocode lists within the code to serve as an outline for various tasks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that arose, was formatting the indents within the code of the index.html file so it looked nice on the webpage. We solved them by going back and forth from VS Code and the browser to check how it looked visually on the screen.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was fairly easy, but tedious when it came to code hygene. This lab has taught me a valuable way to think of how I want to approach programming before actually coding. This has been a valuable experience for me and my lab partner.</p>
