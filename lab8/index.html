			<h1>Lab 8 - Anonymous Functions & Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was creating an anonymous function and a regular function. We first created our functions in browser console, then we it into a JavaScript file.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had issues translating the functions from the direct console and into a JavaScript file. We figured it out by comparing our code to the example provided on the Lab instructions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This Lab was more difficult than other ones, but I feel like I got a lot out of it considering we had to problem solve how to translate the direct console code into JavaScript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results/Script Output</h2>
